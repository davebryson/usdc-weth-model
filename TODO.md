- Refactor code
- Check math on balances, etc...
- use the notebook approach for demo

Note: you'll need to build snapshots based on the number of model steps

** Finding the quoted exact price using root_scalar is REQUIRED. Otherwise price diffs 
are so large the search over many steps drains the agents balance!  Forking the initial 
snapshot is a heavier lift than the simulation!

- What am I showing??
- How can I better explain the charts?
